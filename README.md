# new-developed-SWAT
The improved SWAT model equipped with an optimized automatic irrigation algorithm (Management Allowed Depletion, MAD), modified groundwater module, and added dynamic CO2 input method.
The improved SWAT enhances the ability to simulate the Groundwater-Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (GSPAC), and can directly simulate the effects of irrigation extraction on groundwater levels under various irrigation and climate scenarios.
